### 1. Defined vs. empirical process control

##### How can we control software development with a process?

###### 1. Through Organizational Maturity

* Repeatable Process
* Capability Maturity Model Integration \(CMMI\)

###### 2. Through Agility

* Software development is empirical by nature
* It cannot be modeled with a defined process

##### Define vs Empirical Process Models

**Defined Process:** Planned, Follows strict rules, Avoids deviations  
**Empirical Process**: Not entirely planned; rather inspect and adapt

###### Defined Process Control Model

* requires that every piece of work is completely understood
* deviations are seen as errors that need to be corrected
* given well defined inputs, the same outputs are generated every time
  * Precondition: All tasks and activities are well defined and provide **predictability** and **repeatability**
  * If the preconditions fail: surprises, loss of control, incomplete / wrong work products

###### Empirical Process Control Model

* not all pieces of work are completely understood; imperfectly defined process
* deviations, errors and failures are seen as opportunities that need to be investigated
* **Expects the unexptected:** control and risk management is exercised through frequent inspection
* Condition when to apply this model:
  * change is frequent and cannot be ignored
  * e.g. change of requirements, change of technology, change in the organization, change of people \(?\)

##### Scrum is based on an Empirical Process Control Model

* Definition \(Rugby\):  A Scrum is a way to **restart the game after an interruption**
* Definition \(Agile Processes\):  Scrum is a technique that **deals with interruptions** \(change\)
  * Manages and controls software and product development with rapidly changing requirements
  * Improves risk management by improved communication and cooperation and the delivery of product increments
