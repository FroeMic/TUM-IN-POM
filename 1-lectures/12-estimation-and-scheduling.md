### 7. Reasons for Schedule Overruns

##### Overview

1. Activities don't finish early
2. Lateness is passed down in the schedule
3. Activities are not independent
4. Multitasking causes more delays
5. Features are not developed by priority
6. Uncertainty is ignored
7. Estimates become commitments

### 9. Summary

##### Estimation is a basis for the decision to start, plan and manage a project

##### Estimating a project is a difficult project management function, however:

* Few software organisations have established a formal estimation process
* The estimation technique influences the result \(Cone of Uncertainty\)

##### Cost should not be estimated before the work is broken down into activities and tasks

* The dependency graph included the dependencies
* Schedule = Dependency Graph + time estimates
