### Project:

* is an undertaking, limited in time, with a clear goal and a specific budget, requiring a concerted effort

* consists of:

* * start date and duration
  * deliverables
  * schedule
  * activities
  * resources

### Role

* defines a set of responsabilites

###### Project manager

* Administer resources

* Make sure the project goals are met

###### Analyst

* Analyse application domain
* Create a taxonomy of the domain abstractions

###### System architect

* Decompose the system into subsystems

* Choose a software architectural style

### Key Concepts for Mapping Roles to People

* authority
* responsibility
* accountability
* delegation
* * reasons for delegation:
  * * time management
    * expertise
    * training

#### Task - Activity - Unit of work

| Task | Activity | Unit of work |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| smallest amount of work monitored by the project manager | consists of many tasks; activities are usually project milestones | higher level activity |

## Organization forms

---

#### Functional Organization

* In a functional organization people are **grouped into departments** \(Finance, production, sales / Analysis, design, testing\)

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :--- | :--- |
| Department members have a good understanding of what they are doing | high chance of overlap/duplicated work |
|  |  |
|  |  |

#### Project-based Organization

* people are assigned to a project, each of which has a problem to be solved
* When to use it: 
* * requirements expected to change during the project
  * project has a high degree of uncertainty

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :--- | :--- |
| New people can be hired who are familiar with the problem or have special capabilities | teams cannout be assembled rapidly |
| responsive to new requirements | Roles/responsibilities have to be redefined for each project |

#### Matrix Organization

* People from different departments of a functional organization are assigned to work on one or more projects

* Challenges:

* * double boss problem \(department manager vs. project manager\)
  * department vs project interests
  * multiple work procedures/reporting systems

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :--- | :--- |
| Teams for projects can be assembled rapidly from departments | Team members are not familiar with each other |
| expertise can be applied to different projects as needed | Team members have different working styles |

**Gradual-Staffing: **hiring people as needed

**Flat-Staffing**: all participants are assigned at the start of the project

#### Why Non-hierarchical project structure?

* Cutting down on bureaucracy

* Reduces development time

* Decisions are expected to be made at each level

  Negative aspect: hard to manage

#### Communication skills

* **Collaboration**\(negotiate requirements with the client and with team members\) 
* **Presentation**\(present parts of the system during reviews\)
* **Management**\(manage the team meetings\)
* **Technical writing**\(write project documentation\)
