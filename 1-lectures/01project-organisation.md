### Project:

* is an undertaking, limited in time, with a clear goal and a specific budget, requiring a concerted effort

* consists of:

  * start date and duration
  * deliverables
  * schedule
  * activities
  * resources

### Role

* defines a set of responsibilites

###### Project manager

* Administer resources
* Make sure the project goals are met

###### Analyst

* Analyse application domain
* Create a taxonomy of the domain abstractions

###### System architect

* Decompose the system into subsystems
* Choose a software architectural style

###### Meeting Management Roles

* **Primary facilitator**: organize the meeting, guide the execution, set up agenda
* **Minute taker**: record the meeting, identify action items and issues, distributes the minutes
* **Time keeper**: make sure time limits are kept

### Key Concepts for Mapping Roles to People

* authority
* responsibility
* accountability
* delegation
  * reasons for delegation:
    * time management
    * expertise
    * training

#### Task - Activity - Unit of work

| Task | Activity | Unit of work |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| smallest amount of work monitored by the project manager | consists of many tasks; activities are usually project milestones | higher level activity \(bigger activity that can consist many smaller activities\) |

#### Project Organization Structures

**Project Function**: an activity that spans the entire duration of a software project

**Work Package**:

* describes a task/activity
* the work product to be produced by that task/activity
* acceptance criteria for it

**Work Product**: the visible outcome of a unit of work

#### Project Organization Structures

* **Decision structure**: It models the control flow: Who decides what?

* **Reporting structure**: Who reports their status to whom?

* **Communication structure**: It models the information flow: Who facilitates communication with whom?

## Organization forms

---

#### Functional Organization

* In a functional organization people are **grouped into departments** \(Finance, production, sales / Analysis, design, testing\)

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :--- | :--- |
| Department members have a good understanding of what they are doing | high chance of overlap/duplicated work |

#### Project-based Organization

* people are assigned to a project, each of which has a problem to be solved
* When to use it: 
  * requirements expected to change during the project
  * project has a high degree of uncertainty

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :--- | :--- |
| New people can be hired who are familiar with the problem or have special capabilities | teams cannout be assembled rapidly |
| responsive to new requirements | Roles/responsibilities have to be redefined for each project |

#### Matrix Organization

* People from different departments of a functional organization are assigned to work on one or more projects

* Challenges:
  * double boss problem \(department manager vs. project manager\)
  * department vs project interests
  * multiple work procedures/reporting systems

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :--- | :--- |
| Teams for projects can be assembled rapidly from departments | Team members are not familiar with each other |
| expertise can be applied to different projects as needed | Team members have different working styles |

---

**Gradual-Staffing: **hiring people as needed

**Flat-Staffing**: all participants are assigned at the start of the project

#### Why Non-hierarchical project structure?

* Cutting down on bureaucracy
* Reduces development time
* Decisions are expected to be made at each level
  Negative aspect: hard to manage

#### Communication

* In large system developments you will spend more time communicating than coding

Soft skills:

* **Collaboration**\(negotiate requirements with the client and with team members\) 
* **Presentation**\(present parts of the system during reviews\)
* **Management**\(manage the team meetings\)
* **Technical writing**\(write project documentation\)

#### Communication Event vs. Communication Mechanism
![](/assets/01comm-event_vs_comm-mech.png)

**Communication Anti-pattern:**
* E-mail
* refactored solution: Slack

#### Software Project Management Plan \(SPMP\)

* The controlling planning document for a software project 
* Specifies the technical and managerial approaches to develop the software product  
* Companion document to the requirements analysis and system design documents  
* May be part of the project agreement
* Very useful at the beginning of the project 

#### Project Agreement \(contract, statement of work, business plan\)

= a document written for a client that defines the scope, duration, cost, deliverables, quantities, delivery  
dates, delivery location

* Client:  individual  or  organization  that  specifies  the  requirements  and  accepts  the  project  deliverables 
* Deliverables: work product to be defined by client â€“ documents, demonstration of requirement;
