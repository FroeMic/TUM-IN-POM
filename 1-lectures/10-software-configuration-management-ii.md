* A branching model controls the concurrent development and defines rules when branches are created and merged
  * structure development according to backlog items
  * work on the same codebase with multiple developers
* Pull Requests facilitate to communicate directly on the changed code
  * Only reviewed code \(high quality\) will be merged to development \(prevents broken window theory\)
  * Reduced overhead for code reviewers \(only changes need to be reviewed\)
  * Inexperienced team members improve their skills \(asynchronous pair programming\)
* Branch and Merge Management are important management activities to structure concurrent development
