### 1. What and How

##### What is special about global projects?

1. Distance
2. Time Zones
3. Culture

##### When does global context occur?

* **Within an organisation:** Global companies have different roles and/or system ownership locations around the world
* **Outsourced delivery model:** onsite, onshore, nearshore, offshor
* **More than one party involved:** implementation partner, hosting partner, cloud delivery, joint venture, ...

### 2. Communication

* Crucial for successful project deliveries and product development
  * Impossible to deliver value without communication
  * Impossible to utilize team capacity without communication
  * **Active communication will make any project successful**
* Miscommunication is a major reason for failed projects, cost overruns, quality problems, project delays
* Lack of communication is one of the biggest reasons for people performing bad and not enjoying work

##### Communication Patterns

* Planned vs unplanned
* Synchronous vs asynchronous
* Vertical vs horizontal
* Formal vs informal
* Internal vs external stakeholders

##### Communication Challenges in Global Context and Mitigation

* **Who to contact** - roster \(dt. Namensliste\)
* **Difficulty of initiating contact** - documentation communication structure
* **Language** - explain back to each other
* **Ineffective communication** - be aware in communication strategy
* **Lack of informal communication** - build relationships

##### What makes good communication?

* Awareness and respect to culture and workload
* Adapting messages to recipient
* Identifying where communication needs to be improved \(find out why people are not communicating\)
* Communication needs to add value for the recipient

###### Find the right tool to communicate

* Slack
* Trello
* Skype
* Jira
* Hangouts

###### Travel

* Invest in meeting face to face
  * Have a satellite in the other location channel things
  * When budgeting the project always negotiate for travel budget

##### Practical Tips

* Focus on more planned communication
* Make sure to schedule time for synchronous communication
* Easily accessible meeting notes
* Invest in tools/facilities to enable informal communication
* Create a mindset of awareness and respect of time
  difference
* Invest in travel

###### Lessons Learned in different roles

Context become more and more international. We are citizens of the world.

* **Requirement Lead**

  * Communicate clearly to developers
  * Ask them to explain back
  * Follow progress

* **Team Lead**

  * Encourage team to find communication hubs
  * Motivation of teams crucial

* **Solution Architect**

  * Initiate and fuel collaboration between teams for solution design &
    code structure

* **Project Manager**

  * Ask for honest input about possibility and feasibility of decisions/asks

### 3. Product Development in a Global Context

##### Differences in Product Development vs Projects

###### Product Development

* done with long term organization and with no decided end date
* important to invest in long term productivity and satisfaction
* adds dependencies by size and product lifecycle
* IT architecture is important
* more mechanisms to handle dependencies needed

###### Projects

* possible to create interimistic teams optimized for short term delivery
  * high investment – high energy
  * can more easily free themselves from patterns and habits and focus on the project goal

##### Architecture and Infrastructure for Global Context

* Think smart when “Slicing the Elephant”
  * split the responsibility for parts of the product in a way that minimizes dependencies
* If possible, choose an architecture that enables distributed teams
  * Continuous integration to avoid planning dependencies
  * Keep product dependencies to a minimum
* Data center location -&gt; performance and data protection aspects

### 4. How does Agile Software Development Work in a Global Setup?

| **Agile Cornerstone** | Challenge in Global Setup | **Mitigation** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Enable People | Dependencies and teams on other locations, feeling distance and being just one in the crows | Focus on visualization of teams and their responsibility, competence exchange |
| Close Collaboration | Teams become isolated, hard to see the full picture | Demos where teams share what they delivered each sprint |
| Team Autonomy | The later in the product lifecycle the more dependencies, hard to slice the elephant | Optimize teams based on autonomy, add collaboration forums to enable autonomy |
| Continuous Improvement | Dependencies and forced timeline leaves little room for improvements | Continuous improvement epic in the backlog |
| Innovation | Hard to find time for innovation | Schedule time for innovation between sprints |

##### Spotify's way of scaling

###### Tribe

* A tech sub department containing a number of Chapters and Squads
* Has a tribe lead
* Every engineer belongs to one tribe

###### Chapter

* Group with similar engineering skills that share knowledge, tools and code
* Has a chapter lead, which is the closest manager to everyone in the chapter

###### Squad

* Work is done in a Squad
* Cross functional, autonomous teams, sit together and build something end-to-end
* Work is prioritized by the PO
* Connected to a specific project or long term mission in a product area

###### Guild

* A community of interest consisting of all associated chapters and everyone else who wants to join in \(e.g. a QA guild\)

##### Practical tips to enable agile methodologies in a global setup

* Add extra collaboration forums
* Keep teams in the same location
* Make sure the teams know about each other and share knowledge between teams
* Make sure to plan for close daily cooperation business people/developers
* Slice the elephant in a way that avoids dependencies to enable team autonomy

### 5. Exercises to Practically Experience Global Setup Challenges

### 6. Summary

* Global context adds challenges and opportunities based on **distance**, **time zones** and **culture**
* Utilize the positive effects of distance, time zones and culture
* Be aware of the **importance of communication**, consciousness in communication throughout the whole project
* Create teams and build your product in a way to enable autonomous teams – “slice the elephant”
* Add extra collaboration forums and enable informal communication
* Be stubborn
