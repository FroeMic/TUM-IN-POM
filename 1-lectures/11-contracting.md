### 1. Motivation

#### 1.1 Why is Contracting important?

##### Questions need to be answered

* What are expected deliverables?
* What is the schedule?
* What about the money?
* What are the responsibilities of the contractor and the client?
* What about change management?

##### Important!

* A contract defines the **basic requirements** of a project \(deliverables, time, money\)
* A contract defines the **basic rules of collaboration**
* However: It does not dictate how to deal with uncertainties \(requirements, innovation, change\)

#### 1.2 Contracting in the Project Lifecycle

##### How does contracting work?

* Part of the project preparation \(pre-development\)
* Procurement, Acquisition and Bidding Procedures

###### Acquisition and Bidding

* Can be very formal
  * e.g. rigorous evaluation and selection processes in the public sector
* Don't underestimate the effort

###### Critical

* Price-Performance Ratio
* Good Estimations
* Good Calculations

##### Contracting: Interaction

###### Decision Gate

* Milestones and Quality Gate
* Requires completed work products to determine project progress
* A project plan is a sequence of decision gates

###### Client Project

* Get a system 
* Often Waterfall like

###### Contractor Project

* Build a system
* Flexible approach

###### =&gt; The formal contracting flow

| **Client** |  | Contractor |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| 1. Request for Proposals | =&gt; |  |
|  | &lt;= \(Offer\) | 2. Submit Offer |
| 3. Contract Awarded | &lt;= \(Contract\) =&gt; | 3. Contract Awarded |
| 4. Iteration scheduled |  | 4. Iteration scheduled |
| 5. Acceptance Completed | &lt;= \(Software\) =&gt; | 5. Acceptance completed |
|  | &lt;= \(Final Project Report\) | 6. Project Completed |
| 7. Project Completed |  |  |

##### Contracting: Roles

Procurement, acquisition and bidding require 'project roles' \(Client, Contractor\). A contract defines responsibilities, deliverables, schedules, procedure for BOTH of them

* **Client** \(also Customer, Purchaser, Contracting Enitity\)
  * Define initial requirements
  * Request proposal\(s\)
  * Monitor \(proposal\) projects
  * Acceptance testing
* **Contractor** \(also Supplier\)
  * Submits offers \(bidding\)
  * Ships results \(software, concrete deliverable, services, ...\)

It gets more tricky, if it is an internal project **without** a contract

* Who is the client? Who is the contractor?
* How to define the agreement?
  * Informal Agreement
  * Formal Agreement
  * Cross-Unit-Collaboration

### 2. Influence Factors

Projects have different influence factors. These are also relevant for the contracting procedures.

###### Main Influence Facors

* Goals
* Business Case
* Initial esitimations
* Legal restrictions

###### Context Variables

* Every project has a variety of context variables, which
  * need to be considered in the contract
  * and have to be addressed properly, while leaving some flexibility
* Context variables and formal legal requirements need to be balanced in order to create a suitable environment for the project

##### Contract Content

* **Services and Responsibilities**
  * Functional Requirements
  * Deadlines \(procedures for delays\)
  * Quality Requirements \(non-functional requirements\)
  * Price and Payment Schedule
  * Acceptance
* **Warranty and Liability**
* **Provisions**
* **Copyrights**
* **Regulations, Standards, Compliance**

### 3. Basic Procedures

#### 3.1 Overview

A project usually starts with a dialog and need preparation \(regardless of acquisition strategy\)

##### Project Acquisition Strategies

1. Pro-Active
2. Re-Active
3. Client request for an offer
4. Call for bids/submissions

##### Preparation in Practice

* Plan the offer's development as a project
  * \[1\] Prepare the Offer
  * \[2\] Develop / Submit the Offer
  * ... \(System is developed\)
  * \[3\] Acceptance of the System under Development
* A contract is **always** concluded based on the accepted offer.

#### 3.2 Prepare the Offer

#### 3.3 Develop the Offer

#### 3.3 Prepare Acceptance

### 4. Legal Aspects

### 5. Practices

### 6. Summary

Contracts define the **basic rules of collaboration** – they set the stage…

##### They define

* Functionality/deliverables and their respective quality
* Responsibilities
* Time/Schedule
* Money

##### Two basic types \(defined and legally solid\)

* Fixed Prices
* Time & Material

Several** additional practices** exist to adopt flexibility and to reflect actual software development business \(changing requirements, technology, etc...\)

##### What are contracts for? \(And for what not ...\)

* Contracts **define rules** =&gt; It is not the goals to outrun the partner
* Contracts **need balance** =&gt; risk share
* Contracts **need to be fair** =&gt; all participating parties have rights and duties

* It is good to have a contract, but in projects ...

  * talk about the system, not paragraphs
  * an open atmosphere is better than a legal skirmish
  * you should name escalation authorities that are NOT lawyers

* **Remember:** A court case may give you justice, but no working software ...
