### 1. Sequential Software Lifecycle Models

##### Properties of sequential models

###### Managers love sequential models

* nice milestones
* no need to look back \(linear model\)
* always one activity at one time
* easy to check progress during development \(e.g. 90% coded, 20% tested\)

###### However, Software Development is non-linear

* **During Design:** problems with requirements are identified
* **During Implementation:** design and requirement problems are found
* **During Testing:** coding errors, design errors and requirement errors are found

##### Validation vs Verification

| **Validation** | Verification |
| :--- | :--- |
| - Assurance that a product, service or system meets the need of the customer and other identified stakeholders | - Evaluation whether or not a product, service or system complies with a regulation, requirement or imposed condition |
| - Often involves acceptance and suitability with **external** customers | - Often an **internal** process |
| **Informally:** _Are you building the right thing?_ | **Informally:** _Are you building it right?_ |

#### 1.1 Waterfall Model

#### 1.2 V-Model

### 2. Iterative Software Lifecycle Models

#### 2.1 Spiral Model

#### 2.2 V-Model XT

#### 2.3 Unified Process

### 3. Agile Software Lifecycle Models

#### 3.1 Extreme Programming \(XP\)

#### 3.2 Kanban \(covered in separate class\)

#### 3.3 Scrum \(covered in separate class\)

### 4. Summary

##### Limits of Empirical Process Control Models

= situations where agile methods might not be appropriate

* when not supported by the company culture
* a project too big for regular complete integration
* environments where is inherently takes a long time to get feedback
* where you cannot realistically test
