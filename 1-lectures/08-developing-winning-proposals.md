### 1. Motivation

#### 1.1 Why Proposals?

##### Definition:** Project**

* Resources are brought together for a period of time, focused on a particular task.
  * e.g. development of a new product
* After the fulfillment of the tasks resources are disbanded and reassigned
* The management of project requires a special type of organisaton
  * to administer project resources effectively
  * to maintain clear accountability for the progress of the project

##### Why do we need proposals?

* Project based organizations are becoming more common
* Large organizations are split into separate companies
* Selling and winning is one part, understanding the scope the other \(even more important\)

#### 1.2 What is a proposal?

##### Definition Proposal

* Legally binding, formal and comprehensive offer to a clients to solve a business problem by defining an appropriately tailored project
* \(not an "offer of marriage"\)

##### Content and Effort to develop a proposal highly depends on the work proposed![](/assets/proposal_effort.png)

##### For normal IT projects a wide variety of project types exist

* Strategic Work \(IT Strategy\)
* Conceptual Work
* Design and Implementation
* Project/Program Management

##### General Structure of a proposal

* Understanding the client's problem
* Describing the solution to the problem
* Work plan \(tasks, time, budget, personnel\) to solve the clients problem
* Prerequisites for the client
  * client time
  * client personnel involvement
  * project equipment
* Pricing
* Legal Issues \(warranty, AGB's, etc\)

###### Legal Issues are an important part of the proposal

* the proposal is legally binding
* highly important questions need to be answered \(e.g. Werkvertrag vs. Dienstvertrag\)
* involve a lawyer \(if not, you can only loose\)
* \(not further covered here\)

###### Pricing is the final step

* Historically projects were priced at "time & material" with a prearranged and negotiated area \(between x and y\) and the price for an hour/day was key
* More options exist now and are becoming more important
  * Fixed price for fixed scope \("all included"\)
  * Bonus for ahead of time delivery
  * Value based billing
