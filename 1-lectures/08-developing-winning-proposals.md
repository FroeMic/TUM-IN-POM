### 1. Motivation

#### 1.1 Why Proposals?

##### Definition:** Project**

* Resources are brought together for a period of time, focused on a particular task.
  * e.g. development of a new product
* After the fulfillment of the tasks resources are disbanded and reassigned
* The management of project requires a special type of organisaton
  * to administer project resources effectively
  * to maintain clear accountability for the progress of the project

##### Why do we need proposals?

* Project based organizations are becoming more common
* Large organizations are split into separate companies
* Selling and winning is one part, understanding the scope the other \(even more important\)

#### 1.2 What is a proposal?

##### Definition Proposal

* Legally binding, formal and comprehensive offer to a clients to solve a business problem by defining an appropriately tailored project
* \(not an "offer of marriage"\)

##### Content and Effort to develop a proposal highly depends on the work proposed![](/assets/proposal_effort.png)

##### For normal IT projects a wide variety of project types exist

* Strategic Work \(IT Strategy\)
* Conceptual Work
* Design and Implementation
* Project/Program Management

##### General Structure of a proposal

* Understanding the client's problem
* Describing the solution to the problem
* Work plan \(tasks, time, budget, personnel\) to solve the clients problem
* Prerequisites for the client
  * client time
  * client personnel involvement
  * project equipment
* Pricing
* Legal Issues \(warranty, AGB's, etc\)

###### Legal Issues are an important part of the proposal

* the proposal is legally binding
* highly important questions need to be answered \(e.g. Werkvertrag vs. Dienstvertrag\)
* involve a lawyer \(if not, you can only loose\)
* \(not further covered here\)

###### Pricing is the final step

* Historically projects were priced at "time & material" with a prearranged and negotiated area \(between x and y\) and the price for an hour/day was key
* More options exist now and are becoming more important
  * Fixed price for fixed scope \("all included"\)
  * Bonus for ahead of time delivery
  * Value based billing

###### Sample

1. Goal
2. Approach and Results
3. Provisioning of Infrastructure for the Project and Participation Obligations
4. Project Organization
5. Milestones and Costs
6. Additional Agreements

### 2. Proposal Process

##### Do you homework first!

* a structured approach is necessary even before biding on a project
* some clients/markets dictate the proposal process \(public tenders\)
* developing proposal is expensive =&gt; focus on the important ones

##### Step 1: Do you want to work for this client?

* Selected / Preferred Client \(new / existing client\)
* History of client towards working with external contractors
* Own history with the client
* Win-Win Situation?

##### Step 2: Do you want to bid for this project

* What is the competition?
* What are your strengths and weaknesses regarding the project?
* What is the estimated effort for developing the proposal?
* Does the project fit into your goals and strategy? \(move to new area, reference project\)
* Evaluate cost/risk proposition

### 3. Key Elements for a Successful Proposal

While all proposals are different five key elements influence a proposal's chance for success:

![](/assets/proposal_key_elements.png)

1. **Interaction**
   1. Enables understanding of issues
   2. Quantity and quality of contacts between Client and proposal team as proposal is being developed
   3. Client access and company knowledge
2. **Issue**
   1. Scope and context of what should be addressed
   2. Making issues and setting direction
3. **Team**
   1. Those who prepare the proposals and meet with the clients
   2. Collaboration, leadership, “on the ground capability”
4. **Message**
   1. Response on how to address the issue
5. **Relationship**
   1. Professional trust and empathy
   2. Measurable strength of relationship

###### Recurring Relationships pay off

The focused pursuit of recurring relationships benefits both parties because it enables to understand client issues better and to ultimately add more value.

* Keep client’s needs in the forefront
* Build peripheral vision of client issues while executing current engagement
* Reduce proposal efforts through better understanding of client issues
* Strengthen the five elements 
* These factors all lead to more value added to the client 

### 4. What makes a Winning Proposal

###### 1. Understand your client's intention and have him/her understand you.

* People do not buy companies or ideas. They buy people.

  ###### 2. Understand your client's needs and boundaries

* Assess decision parameters of the client thoroughly.

* A perfect 'full sized' solution will not be pursued, if it is way off the client's budget or the client wants to fix only part of the problem 

###### 3. Build the 'right' relationships

* Assess the buyer situation with a 'power map' of the client
* Who is the 'real buyer'? Who decides about the proposal? What is his / her motivation for the project?

###### 4. Make sure that your team has the right skill-mix and be flexible to adjust

* The content of the proposal is key to winning a project
* You need and expert team to deliver quality content, relationships, legal structure, etc.
* If the focus of the proposal shifts to another functional area, make sure you include the necessary skills in your team

###### 5. Learn from every proposal. Including failures

* Assess reasons for failures and lessons learned
* Share your knowledge and actively seek support from other and their experience
* Identify advantages in competitors

###### 6. Be careful with your language

* Use professional language.
* Avoid overstating and exaggerating language

###### 7. The proposal is only the first step of the project

* Promise only what you can deliver
* If you don't, you will not get another project with that client.
* It is harder to win trust than to lose it.
