### 1. Motivation

#### 1.1 Usability Disasters

Many Software Failures are due to Faults in the User Interface. Examples:

* German / Munich MVV ticket machines
* Questionably labeled elevator buttons
* Control rooms in nuclear power plants

#### 1.2 Terminology

##### Usability

* measures how well a user can use the system functionality
* is measured in 5 categories
  * **\[1\] Learnability:** faster to learn =&gt; higher usability
  * **\[2\] Efficiency:** less steps to accomplish =&gt; higher usability
  * **\[3\] Memorability:** how quickly can a user reestablish proficiency
  * **\[4\] Errors:** amount of errors by the user, severity, recoverability
  * **\[5\] Satisfaction:** users come back more often, if the design / experience is pleasant

**"The system is easy to use"** - frequently misused term, often such systems are rather unusable  
**Unusability** - the user has extreme difficulties to learn or use the system  
**User Experience** - A person's perceptions and responses that result from the use and/or anticipated use of a product, system or service. \(= all effectsof a product /service on the user, **before, during** and **after** the interaction\)

##### \(Good\) User Interfaces are hard to design

###### Developer is not equal to the user

* Developers mostly communicate with other developers
* UI development is about communicating with users

###### The User is always right

* consistent problems are the system's fault

###### ... but the User is not always right

* users are not designers

###### UI development takes effort

* 50% of design, implementation and maintenance

###### Managers must be involved \(usability management\)

##### Usability Management

Usability is multidimensional

1. Learnability: Is the UI easy to learn?
2. Efficiency: Once learned, is it fast to use?
3. Memorability: Is it easy to remember what the user has learned?
4. Error Handling / Robustness: Are errors recoverable?
5. Satisfaction: Is the UI enjoyable to use?

### 2. Usability Heuristics \(Nielsen\)

### 3. Usability Testing

### 4. Prototyping

### 5. Usability and Serious Games

### 6. Summary

##### General

* Usability is important
* Heuristics \(e.g. Nielsen's 10 heuristics\) help to evaluate / test the usability of a system

##### Benefits of Prototyping

* allow to get early feedback -&gt; saves time while developing
* easier to understand the texts or diagrams -&gt; easier communication
* improve usability

##### Benefits of Serious Games

* increase motivation
* focus on fun

##### Usability

* measures how well a user can use the system functionality 
* is measure in 5 categories
  * Learnability
  * Efficiency
  * Memorability
  * Errors
  * Satisfaction
* Meet expectations, The User is the Boss, Handle Errors, KISS

##### How to reach good usability

* **Follow Usability Heuristics:** e.g. Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics
* **Usability Testing:** Test your ideas
* **Prototyping:** Identify problems early
* **Serious Games:** Focus on fun and motivation
* **Human Capabilities:** Model of the User \(Newell\)
