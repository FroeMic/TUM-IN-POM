### 1. Motivation

#### 1.1 Challenges of Day-to-Day IT Project Work

##### Software Project Mananger

* Have a hard time setting clear priorities and making corresponding decisions
* They do not understand how their team works an why it 'does not work' the way they want it to.
* They are frustrated because the team does not manage to 'work according to plan'

##### Project Team

* Members are overwhelmed and stressed.
* The development takes longer than planned because the team members continuously have to justify their actions to management and are interrupted.
* The quality of the finished software is insufficient.
* They do not understand why the management makes such significant changes to the direction of the work and wants something different every day.

### 2. Origin: Toyota Production System

###### Motivation: Toyota

* Storage Capacity extremely expensive
* Production 'from stock' not financially feasible
* How can we optimize vehicle production so that we need as little storage capacity as possible?

##### Lean Production

* organize the flow of material similar to a supermarket
* consumer can pick and item, only then it is restocked
* lead to development of Toyota Production System

#### 2.1 Toyota Production System (TPS)

##### Production only On-Demand

* Only produce what will be consumed
* 'Pull' mechanism forms the basis of Kanban
* Event-based (not clocked) system
* Challenge: Keep the pipeline filled.

##### Product Management using Cards

* Cards (Jap. Kanban)signal tasks to do
    * Handed over from station to station when a task is finished
    * Number of tasks **limited** for each station
* **Pull:** Only when a worker has nothing more to do, he will 'pull' the next task from the pipeline
* Challenge: Keep the pipeline going (everyone is busy)

##### Special Challenges

* **Lead Time:** Time between receiving a receipt and delivery of the product. (should be as short as possible)
* **Just in Time:** The production process should be designed as efficient and effective as possible in order to save costs. (storage costs, pipeline stall costs)
* **Optimization:** Minimize production effort while maximizing product quality.

#### 2.1 Optimization of the TPS using Kaizen

* Kaizen is evolution, not revolution!
* Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there Is nothing
left to take away.

##### 3 Steps

1. Recognize Potential (= eliminate redundancy)
2. Change the Process
3. Measurement and Analysis

##### Muda, Mura, Muri

* **Muda:** every activity / process that does not add value to the production (=> tailoring)
* **Mura:** waste resulting from inhomogeneity and inconsistency
* **Muri:** waste resulting from misused resources (machines / workers)

###### Muda

* Activities / Processes without added value
* Potential improvement in the following areas:
    * **Transport:** The movement of the product between different production plants and production steps
    * **Warehouse Stock:** Items currently WIP, material and finished products within the company
    * **Movement:** Physical movement of people and machines during operation
    * **Wait Time:** When people / machines are ready for operation, but have to wait
    * **Overproduction:** Producing more than the customer ordered
    * **Overworking:** Doing more than the customer needs
    * **Defects:** Rejects and Defect Elimination during the production process

###### Mura

* Waste resulting from inhomogeneity and inconsistency
* Goal would be consistent, need-based capacity utilization

###### Muri

* Waste resulting from overload
* Potential improvement in the following areas:
    * Employees perform tasks they have not been trained to do
    * Non-ergonomic work spaces
    * Dirty and messy work spaces
    * Work instructions that are not clear
    * Insufficient tool support and kits
    * Insufficient maintenance and servicing
    * Tools and processes that are not allowed
    * Insufficient communication and insufficient feedback to the manager

### 3. Transfer: Kanban in IT
