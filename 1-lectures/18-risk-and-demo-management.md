### 1. Risk Management

_Risks must be taken because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing._

##### Risk

* ... is the deviation of a result of a future event from expectations
* ... is uncertain whether it will materialize or 
* ... is a potential harm that may arise of such an event
* ... depends on our decisions

**Murphys's Law:** _“Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong”_

##### Risk Differentiation

##### Risk Assessment

**Important:** Accept the uncertain, but identify risks!

###### Identify Risks

* What might affect the project objectives? (internal / external)
* Performed by project management AND team
* **Methods:** brainstorming, checklists, expert discussions, SWOT analysis
* Categorize risks (complexity, technology, communication, ...)
* Assign risk triggers
* In agile Projects (Scrum)
    * Daily Scrum: status, **impediments**, promises
    * Sprint Review: identify improvements for next sprint

###### Risk Assessment Matrix

* 3 Dimensions: Impact, Probability, Control

##### Risk Mitigation

Risk Mitigations can be grouped into 4 possible types.

1. **Avoidance**
    * Try to avoid risk occurrence
    * Mostly used at planning phase
2. **Control**
    * Identify actions to control risk occurrence and impact
    * Most common response
3. **Transfer**
    * Delegate risk (e.g. to subcontractors)
4. **Investigation**
    * Try to analyze risk further
    * Risk is not reduced

###### Risk Mitigation Plan

* Periodic Risk Assessment
* Possible Escalation to upper management

##### Risk Management Skills

1. **Rules**
    * Update risk log
    * Establish contingency plan
2. **Knowledge**
    * Specific IT knowledge
    * Business / functional know how
3. **Distance**
    * Challenge time and cost estimates
    * Listen to different opinions
4. **Intuition**
    * Expert Estimations
    * Feeling about risks and problems

### 2. Demo Management

#### 2.1. Tornado Model: From Visionary Scenario  to Demo Scenario

#### 2.2 Mock Object Pattern

### 3. Summary

* Preparing a great demo of your application convinces the customer
    * Play the role of the user of the application in an authentic way, e.g. dress up like the real user
    * Use humor in your demonstrations (but: don’t overdo it)
* Prepare a screenplay with the scenes of the demo (based on the event-flow of the demo
scenario)
* Use the mock object pattern to mimic the behavior of collaborating objects that are not
implemented yet
* With a great demo, all stakeholders understand the purpose of the application
* Remember Murphy’s Law and prepare for it: _“anything that can go wrong, will go wrong”_
    * Use risk management and have a backup plan if risks materialize as problems
    * Prepare backups for your demo, e.g. videos and images
