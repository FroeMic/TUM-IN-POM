### 5. Summary

* Preparing a great demo of your application convinces the customer
    * Play the role of the user of the application in an authentic way, e.g. dress up like the real user
    * Use humor in your demonstrations (but: don’t overdo it)
* Prepare a screenplay with the scenes of the demo (based on the event-flow of the demo
scenario)
* Use the mock object pattern to mimic the behavior of collaborating objects that are not
implemented yet
* With a great demo, all stakeholders understand the purpose of the application
* Remember Murphy’s Law and prepare for it: _“anything that can go wrong, will go wrong”_
    * Use risk management and have a backup plan if risks materialize as problems
    * Prepare backups for your demo, e.g. videos and images
