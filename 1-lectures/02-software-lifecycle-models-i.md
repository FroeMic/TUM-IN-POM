### 1. Software development as application domain

#### 1.1 Introduction

##### Inherent Problems with Software Development

* Requirements are constantly changing / not known in advance
* Frequent changes are difficult to manage \(checkpoints for estimation & planning are difficult to identify\)
* Several Systems of different maturity need to be considered

##### Why do we need Software Lifecycle Models?

* Development of large systems requires _organized approach_
* Software Management can be seen as complex system
* Methods to model systems \(e.g. UML\) can be used to model Software Management

**Software Lifecycle:** \(also Software Process\)  
Set of activities and their relationships to each other to support the development of a software system.

**Software Lifecycle Model:** \(also Software Process Model\)  
An abstraction that represents a software lifecycle for the purpose of understanding, monitoring, or controlling the development of a software system.

#### 1.2 Modeling

##### Where do we need Models?

* **\[A\] Communication:** Models provide a common vocabulary. Informal models can be used to communicate an idea.
* **\[B\] Analysis / Design:** Models enable developers to reason about a future system.
* **\[C\] Archival:** Compact representation of the design and rational of a system \(documentation\).

##### How much modeling?

* **Advantages**
  * enable developers to deal with complexity
  * make implicit knowledge about the system explicit
  * formalize knowledge and make it 'shareable'
* **Disadvantages**
  * models can themselves become very complex

##### \[A\] Models that support Communication

* called _Communication Models_
* purpose: communicate and idea to another **person** \(support communication!\)
* used in early phases of the project, during informal meetings
* does NOT need to be consistent, complete or have correct notation
* e.g. napkin model, whiteboard, mockup

##### \[B\] Models that support Analysis / Design

* called Specification_ Models_
* purpose: provide a representation to reason about the system
* used to communicate an idea to a **tool**
* needs to be consistent and complete
* needs to have correct notation, so it can be entered into CASE tool
