###### 12 July - 18 July

###### Slides: [Moodle](https://www.moodle.tum.de/mod/resource/view.php?id=603988)

### 1. Motivation

* Product development and project management are different
* User Story Mapping is a good technique for providing initial rough estimations of a system
* Software architecture is importany
* Quality attributes should drive the architecture
* Software architecture can be managed continuously
* Duties of the _Software Architect_ role

##### The world is changing fast ... 

* Requirements may only be _hypotheses_ and change quickly
* Current market trend is that _products_ change to _services_  \(first mover often win\)
* High uncertainty requires a different mindset than traditional environments \(Lean Startup, Design Thinking\)
* Agile software development and good software architecture enable the necessary flexibility

### 2. Product vs Project

### 3. Agile Release Planning

### 4. Agile Software Architecture

### 5. Current trends: DDD and Microservices

### 6. Summary

##### Without Good Software Architecture

* Adding features will get more and more expensive
* Developers don‘t want to work on the system
* If you change one part of the system, a completly mentally unrelated other part of the system might get broken
* You can‘t use the system in other environments than the current one
* you have to think about rewriting the whole system \(expensive, big risk\) or get out of business..

##### 6 Principles of Continuous Architecture

1. Architect products, not just solutions for projects
2. Focus on Quality Attributes, not on functional requirements
3. Delay design decisions until they are absolutely necessary
4. Architect for change – „leverage the power of small“
5. Architect for build, test and deploy
6. Model the organization after the design of the system

7. Think in products

8. Agile estimation and planning of products is possible, e.g. with User Story Mapping
9. Software Architecture is important to create and maintain the foundation of products and have options for the future
