### 6. Summary

##### Without Good Software Architecture

* Adding features will get more and more expensive
* Developers don‘t want to work on the system
* If you change one part of the system, a completly mentally unrelated other part of the system might get broken
* You can‘t use the system in other environments than the current one
* you have to think about rewriting the whole system \(expensive, big risk\) or get out of business..

##### 6 Principles of Continuous Architecture

1. Architect products, not just solutions for projects
2. Focus on Quality Attributes, not on functional requirements
3. Delay design decisions until they are absolutely necessary
4. Architect for change – „leverage the power of small“
5. Architect for build, test and deploy
6. Model the organization after the design of the system

* Think in products
* Agile estimation and planning of products is possible, e.g. with User Story Mapping
* Software Architecture is important to create and maintain the foundation of products and have options for the future
